# NES emulator in Rust

Project made follwing the [NES Ebook](https://bugzmanov.github.io/nes_ebook/chapter_1.html)

This is a project that I planned to make on a weekend but I overly underestimated it

## Progress

- [x] CPU
- [x] PPU
- [x] JOYPADS (need to create configuration for two players)
- [ ] APU
- [ ] Implement CLI arguments

The book isn't complete yet, so the APU is not implemented, and I don't think I have necessary knowledge to do it by my self yet, perhaps after reading the recommended material on the book I come back to this project.
